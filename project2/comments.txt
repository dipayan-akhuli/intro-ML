Encoding seasons - One-hot encoding because no natural ordering between seasons, so makes sense to have different seasons as different features (binary values), each season could be a class on its own
Imputation - Tried both kNN and Iterative, Iterative probably requires more complete records, less missing values, tried different seeds; kNN worked better, tried different num_neighbors and weighting schemes, 5 neighbours and uniform weighting worked best, others had convergence issues for some kernels
Model fitting - Tried 4 kernels - DotProduct, Matern, RBF, RationalQuadratic - all default parameters, used 5-fold CV to choose the kernel - RationalQuadratic gave highest cross-validation R^2 value - used this kernel to fit the whole training dataset, this R^2 was very close to 1 so we did not tweak the kernel parameters
